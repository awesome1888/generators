<Container>

I do not explicitly collect any sort of personal data on my website. The contact form contains a field to let me know how to contact the author of the message.
However, this field is not obligatory and it is totally up to the author what kind of information to provide there.

Any kind of personal data the author has voluntarily submitted while filling up the body of the message, as well as in the contact field, I do not store and do not process.
After reading the message by me, it gets immediately wiped out of the system.

However, if you are still looking for more information then you can contact me by sending an email to <Email />
