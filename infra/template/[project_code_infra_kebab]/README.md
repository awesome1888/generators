## Deploying the infrastructure

### Preparations

The infrastructure is managed by [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli). In case if this is a new machine, or the project itself is a brand new one, we must obtain the required access keys first.

#### AWS

AWS is a keystone for everything. We use AWS to store Terraform states, as well as to host different resources, such as Lambdas, S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.

* Go to the AWS console and [create a new user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=details) or [add a new access key for an existing one](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/RoboAdmin?section=security_credentials).
* Fill out the env vars in the `.env` file:
  ~~~bash
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
  ~~~

Useful resources:
* [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)

#### Domain name

Buy your new domain name at [GoDaddy](https://account.godaddy.com/products).
You can also try [RuCenter](https://www.nic.ru/en/), since ru-domains are cheaper there. Beware though, that they only allow changing the domain nameservers, but don't give fully-featured access to the DNS hosting free of charge, unlike GoDaddy.

#### GoDaddy

Adding __A__ and __CNAME__ records for your GoDaddy domain.

* Go to Godaddy and [create a new key/secret](https://developer.godaddy.com/keys).
* Fill out the env vars in the `.env` file:
  ~~~bash
  export GODADDY_API_KEY=
  export GODADDY_API_SECRET=
  ~~~

Useful resources:
* [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/n3integration/godaddy/latest)

#### Auth0

If you need authentication, there is Auth0.

* Go to the [settings section of the RoboApp](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/eu/gannochenko/applications/xsZ4bfyjGVCcZX2uT1jar0fHLvf5FlOQ/settings) and retrieve the following data:
* Fill out the env vars in the `.env` file:
  ~~~bash
  export AUTH0_DOMAIN=
  export AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
  export AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
  ~~~

Useful resources:
* [Tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/use-terraform-to-manage-your-auth0-configuration/)
* [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/alexkappa/auth0/latest/docs)

#### Vercel

If you host on Vercel, then:

* Go to the [tokens page](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) and create a new token. Then retrieve the data:
* Fill out the env vars in the `.env` file:
  ~~~bash
  export VERCEL_TOKEN=
  ~~~

Useful resources:
* [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/chronark/vercel/latest/docs)

### Deploying locally

~~~bash
./script/init.sh
./script/plan.sh
./script/apply.sh
~~~

## Setting up CD

Take all variables from the `./.env` file and create [repository secrets](https://github.com/gannochenko/gannochenko.dev_infra/settings/secrets/actions) with the same names:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
* AUTH0_DOMAIN
* AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
* AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
* VERCEL_TOKEN
* GODADDY_API_KEY
* GODADDY_API_SECRET
